Regional terms may also meet this test. Also, players must use gestures with caution when facing action; tapping the table is a check.

If a player does not fully table his cards, then mucks thinking he has won, he does so at his risk.

Any player in the event may request a clock. If the floor approves the request, a player has up to 50 seconds to act. If action is not taken before time expires, there will be a 10-second count. If the player does not act by the end of the count, the hand is dead. A tie goes to the player.

His blinds and antes are posted and if dealt the stud bring-in card he posts the bring-in. A player must be at his seat to call time. &ldquo;At your seat&rdquo; means within reach of your chair.

If a player does both, whichever is first defines the bet. If simultaneous, a clear and reasonable verbal declaration takes precedence, otherwise the chips play.</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Verbal declarations may be general (&ldquo;call&rdquo;, &ldquo;raise&rdquo;), a specific amount only (&ldquo;one thousand&rdquo;) or both (&ldquo;raise, one thousand&rdquo;).</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">For all betting rules, declaring a specific amount only is the same as silently pushing out an equal amount. Ex: Declaring &ldquo;two hundred&rdquo; is the same as silently pushing out 200 in chips.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="25"><li class="c2"><span class="c3">Acting in Turn</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Players must act in turn verbally and/or by pushing out chips. Action in turn is binding and commits chips to the pot that stay in the pot.</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Players must wait for clear bet amounts before acting. Ex: NLHE, A says &ldquo;raise&rdquo; (but no amount), and B quickly folds. B should wait to act until A&rsquo;s raise amount is clear.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="26"><li class="c2"><span class="c3">Binding Declarations / Undercalls in Turn</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">General verbal declarations in turn (such as &ldquo;Call&rdquo; or &ldquo;Raise&rdquo;) commit a player to the full current action. See Illustration Addendum.</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">A player undercalls by declaring or pushing out less than the call amount without first declaring &ldquo;call&rdquo;. An undercall is a mandatory full call if made in turn facing 1) any bet heads-up or 2) the opening bet on any round multi-way. In other situations, TD&rsquo;s discretion applies. The posted BB is the opening first round bet in blind games. All-in buttons greatly reduce undercall frequency (See Recommended Procedure 1). This rule addresses when a player must make a full call and when, at TDs discretion, he may forfeit the underbet and fold.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="27"><li class="c2"><span class="c3">Action Out of Turn (OOT)</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Any action out of turn (check, call, or raise) is subject to penalty and is binding if action to the OOT player does not change. &nbsp;A check, call or fold by the rightful player does not change action. If action changes, the OOT action is not binding; any bet or raise is returned to the OOT player who has all options including: calling, raising, or folding. An OOT fold is binding.</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">A player skipped by OOT action must defend his right to act. If there is reasonable time and the skipped player does not speak up before substantial action &nbsp;OOT occurs to his left, the OOT action is binding. The floor will rule on how to treat the skipped hand. <br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="28"><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Methods of Calling<br></span><span class="c1">Standard and acceptable forms of calling include: A) saying &ldquo;call&rdquo;; B) pushing out chips equal to a call; C) silently pushing out an overchip; or D) silently pushing out multiple chips equal to a call under the multi-chip rule. Silently betting chip(s) relatively tiny to the bet (ex: blinds 2k-4k. A bets 50k, B then silently puts out one 1k chip) is non-standard, strongly discouraged, subject to penalty, and will be interpreted at TDs discretion, including being ruled a full call.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Methods of Raising<br></span><span class="c8">In no-limit or pot-limit, a raise must be made by A) pushing out the full amount in one motion; B) verbally declaring the full amount prior to pushing out chips; or C) verbally declaring &ldquo;raise&rdquo; prior to pushing out the exact call amount then completing the raise in one additional motion. In option C, if other than the exact call amount but less than a minimum raise is first put out, it will be ruled a minimum raise. </span><span class="c8 c13">It is the responsibility of players to make their intentions clear.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c3">Raise Amounts</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">A raise must be at least equal to the largest prior bet or raise of the current betting round. If a player raises 50% or more of the largest prior bet but less than a minimum raise, he must make a full minimum raise. If less than 50% it is a call unless &ldquo;raise&rdquo; is first declared. Declaring an amount or pushing out the same amount of chips is the same. Ex: NLHE, opening bet is 1000, verbally declaring &ldquo;Fourteen hundred&rdquo; or silently pushing out 1400 in chips are both calls unless raise is first declared. </span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Without other clarifying information, declaring raise and an amount is the total bet. Ex: A opens for 2000, B declares &ldquo;Raise, eight thousand.&rdquo; The total bet is 8000.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="31"><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Oversized Chip Betting<br></span><span class="c1">When facing a bet or blind, pushing out a single oversized chip is a call if raise isn&rsquo;t first declared. To raise with an oversized chip, raise must be declared before the chip hits the table surface. If raise is declared but no amount, the raise is the maximum allowable for the chip. When not facing a bet, pushing out an oversized chip without declaration is a bet of the maximum for the chip.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Multiple Chip Betting<br></span><span class="c1">When facing a bet, unless raise is declared first, a multiple-chip bet is a call if every chip is needed to make the call; i.e. removal of just one of the smallest chips leaves less than the call amount. Example: preflop, 200-400 blinds: A raises to 1200 total (an 800 raise), B puts out two 1000 chips without declaring raise. This is just a call because removing one 1000 chip leaves less than the amount to call (1200). If the single removal of just one of the smallest chips leaves the call amount or more, the bet is governed by the 50% standard rule. <br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c3">Previous Bet Chips Not Pulled In</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">If a player bets when facing a raise and has chips in front of him not yet pulled in from a prior bet, the &ldquo;prior&rdquo; chips (and any change due) may affect whether his action is ruled a call or re-raise. Because several possibilities exist, players should declare their bets before putting out new chips on top of prior-bet chips not yet pulled in.</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">If facing action, clearly pulling back prior bet chip(s) binds a player to call or raise.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="34"><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Number of Allowable Raises<br></span><span class="c1">There is no cap on the number of raises in no-limit and pot-limit. In limit play there is a limit to raises even when heads-up until the event is down to 2 players; the house limit applies.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Accepted Action<br></span><span class="c1">Poker is a game of alert, continuous observation. It is the caller&rsquo;s responsibility to determine the correct amount of an opponent&rsquo;s bet before calling, regardless of what is stated by others. If a caller requests a count but receives incorrect information from a dealer or player, then pushes out that amount, the caller has accepted the full correct action &amp; is subject to the correct wager or all-in amount. As with all situations, Rule 1 may apply at TD&rsquo;s discretion.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">String Bets and Raises<br></span><span class="c1">Dealers will call string bets and raises.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Non-Standard &amp; Unclear Betting<br></span><span class="c1">Players use unofficial betting terms and gestures at their own risk. These may be interpreted to mean other than what the player intended. Also, if a declared bet can reasonably have multiple meanings, it will be ruled the lesser value. Ex: NLHE 200-400 blinds, player declares &ldquo;I bet five.&rdquo; If it is unclear whether &ldquo;five&rdquo; means 500 or 5,000, the bet is 500.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Non-Standard Folds<br></span><span class="c8">Anytime before the end of the </span><span class="c5">final</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;betting round, folding in turn if there&rsquo;s no bet to you (ex: facing a check or first to act post-flop) or folding out of turn are binding folds subject to penalty.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Conditional Statements<br></span><span class="c1">Conditional statements of future action are non-standard and strongly discouraged. At TDs discretion they may be binding and/or penalized. Example: &ldquo;if &ndash; then&rdquo; statements such as &ldquo;If you bet, I will raise.&rdquo;<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Count of Opponent&rsquo;s Chip Stack<br></span><span class="c1">Players are entitled to a reasonable estimation of opponents&rsquo; chip stacks &nbsp;A player may only request a more precise count if the action is on him and he faces an all-in bet. The all-in player is not required to count; on request the dealer or floor will count it. Accepted action applies. The visible and countable chipstack rule greatly helps accuracy in counting.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Over-Betting Expecting Change<br></span><span class="c8">Betting should not be used to obtain change. Pushing out more than the intended bet can confuse everyone at the table. All chips pushed out silently are at risk of being counted </span><span class="c5">in</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the bet. Example: The opening bet is 325 to A and he silently puts out 525 (one 500 and one 25), expecting 200 change. This is a raise to 650 under the multiple chip rule.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">All-In with Chips Found Behind Later<br></span><span class="c1">If A bets all-in and a hidden chip is found behind after a player has called, the TD will determine if the chip behind is part of accepted action. If not part of the action, A will not be paid off for the chip(s) if he wins. If A loses he is not saved by the chip(s) and the TD may award the chip(s) to the winning caller.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Chips Out of View and in Transit<br></span><span class="c1">Players may not hold or transport chips in a way that takes them out of view. A player who does so will forfeit the chips and may be disqualified. The forfeited chips will be taken out of play.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Lost and Found Chips<br></span><span class="c1">Lost and found chips will be taken out of play and returned to tournament inventory.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Accidentally Killed / Fouled Hands<br></span><span class="c1">A player must protect his hand at all times, including at showdown while waiting for the hand to be read. If the dealer kills a hand by mistake or if in TDs judgement a hand is fouled and cannot be identified to 100% certainty, the player has no redress and is not entitled to a refund of called bets. If the player initiated a bet or raise and hasn&rsquo;t been called, the uncalled amount will be returned to him. If a hand is fouled but can be identified, it remains in play despite cards exposed in the process.<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">No Disclosure<br></span><span class="c8">One-player-to-a-hand is in effect. Among other things, this rule prohibits showing a hand to or discussing strategy with another player, advisor, or spectator. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Players must protect their cards from other players in the tournament at all times. Therefore players, whether in the hand or not, must not:</span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-1 start" start="1"><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Disclose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contents of live or folded hands,</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Advise or criticize play at any time,</span></li><li class="c0"><span class="c1">Read a hand that hasn&rsquo;t been tabled.<br></span></li></ol><ol class="c6 lst-kix_8jq5b23xn3ex-0" start="47"><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Exposing Cards and Proper Folding<br></span><span class="c1">A player who exposes his cards with action pending may incur a penalty, but will not have a dead hand. When folding, cards should be pushed forward low to the table, not deliberately exposed or tossed high (&ldquo;helicoptered&rdquo;).<br></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Ethical Play<br></span><span class="c1">Poker is an individual game. Soft play will result in penalties, which may include chip forfeiture and/or disqualification.

Examples include but are not limited to: persistent delay of the game, unnecessarily touching other players&rsquo; cards or chips, repeatedly acting out of turn, betting out of reach of the dealer, abusive conduct, and excessive chatter.</span></li></ol></body></html>
